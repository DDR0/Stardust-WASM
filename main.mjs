//Then, allocate the data views into the memory.

Must transfer memory BEFORE world. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1421524 2. Must transfer world BEFORE memory. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1821582

//Run the simulation thrice. Each thread should print a hundred numbers in order, thrice.
//For thread 1, it should print 0, then 1, then 2, etc. up to 99.
//Thread 2 should run from 100 to 199, and thread 3 200 to 299.
//But when they're run simultaneously, all three threads seem to use the same counter.
