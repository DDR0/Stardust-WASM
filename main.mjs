//Let's count to 300. We'll have three web workers, each taking ⅓rd of the task. 0-100, 100-200, 200-300...

//First, allocate some shared memory. (The original task wants to share some values around.)
//64 pages (4 MiB) leaves room for the module's static data/heap plus a separate
//shadow-stack + TLS block per worker thread (see worker/sim.mjs for the layout).

	initial: 64,
	maximum: 64,

//This is shared memory which will get updated by the worker threads, off the main thread.
const world = {
	globalTick: new Int32Array(memory.buffer, 1200000, 1), //Current global tick. Increment to tell the workers to count up in scratchA!
}

//Load a core and send the "start" event to it.
const startAWorkerCore = coreIndex => {
	const worker = new Worker('worker/sim.mjs', {type:'module'})

Must transfer memory BEFORE world. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1421524 2. Must transfer world BEFORE memory. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1821582
}

//Now, let's start some worker threads! They will work on different memory locations, so they don't conflict.
//Each worker now gets its own shadow stack + TLS block (see worker/sim.mjs), so all
//three count their own range concurrently without clobbering each other's locals.

//Run the simulation thrice. Each thread should print a hundred numbers in order, thrice.
//For thread 1, it should print 0, then 1, then 2, etc. up to 99.
//Thread 2 should run from 100 to 199, and thread 3 200 to 299.
//But when they're run simultaneously, all three threads seem to use the same counter.
